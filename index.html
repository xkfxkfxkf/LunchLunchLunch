        <h1>Welcome to Lunch? Lunch? Lunch? v1.0!</h1>

        <p>The purpose of Lunch? Lunch? Lunch? is to help the poor and indecisive souls of York St 
        decide where they'll go to get lunch. Too many seconds into minutes into hours 
        into days into weeks into months into <strong><em>years</strong></em> continue to get lost to 
        the most difficult decision every single day, 'what should we get for lunch?'</p>

        <p>Can you imagine how many moderation tickets we could do in the time it's taken us to choose 
        where to eat?</p>

        <h3>Lunch? Lunch? Lunch? can:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Do this!</li>
            <li>Do that!</li>
            <li>And more!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's go to... </p>
